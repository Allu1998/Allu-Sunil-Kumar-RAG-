Authors :  Mogens  Frank  Mikkelsen,  Carl  Marnewick,  Louis  Klein  
Summary :  
This
 
paper
 
explores
 
the
 
role
 
of
 
"stupidity"
 
in
 
project
 
management
 
within
 
the
 
context
 
of
 
a
 
VUCA
 
(Volatile,
 
Uncertain,
 
Complex,
 
and
 
Ambiguous)
 
world.
 
While
 
project
 
complexity
 
is
 
often
 
blamed
 
for
 
failures,
 
the
 
authors
 
argue
 
that
 
it
 
frequently
 
serves
 
as
 
a
 
convenient
 
excuse
 
for
 
poor
 
decision-making
 
and
 
irrational
 
stakeholder
 
behavior.
 
Through
 
an
 
analysis
 
of
 
1,064
 
survey
 
responses
 
from
 
project
 
management
 
practitioners,
 
the
 
study
 
reveals
 
that
 
stakeholders
 
fail
 
to
 
engage
 
with
 
complexity
 
in
 
a
 
meaningful
 
way,
 
often
 
demonstrating
 
decision-making
 
that
 
borders
 
on
 
irrationalityâ€”what
 
the
 
authors
 
term
 
"stupidity."
 
The  research  highlights  how  project  stakeholders  frequently  disregard  common  sense,  misunderstand  complexity,  and  mismanage  
projects
 
due
 
to
 
cognitive
 
biases,
 
lack
 
of
 
critical
 
thinking,
 
and
 
adherence
 
to
 
rigid
 
structures.
 
The
 
authors
 
frame
 
this
 
phenomenon
 
within
 
the
 
concept
 
of
 
"functional
 
stupidity,"
 
a
 
term
 
from
 
organizational
 
theory
 
describing
 
the
 
avoidance
 
of
 
reflexivity,
 
justification,
 
and
 
substantive
 
reasoning.
 
They
 
argue
 
that
 
project
 
failures
 
are
 
often
 
not
 
just
 
due
 
to
 
external
 
complexities
 
but
 
also
 
due
 
to
 
an
 
internal
 
unwillingness
 
to
 
challenge
 
flawed
 
assumptions
 
and
 
practices.
 
Furthermore,  the  paper  suggests  that  traditional  project  management  approaches,  which  emphasize  control  and  predictability,  are  
ill-suited
 
for
 
complex
 
environments.
 
Instead,
 
the
 
authors
 
advocate
 
for
 
systemic
 
thinking
 
and
 
adaptive
 
management
 
strategies
 
that
 
acknowledge
 
the
 
unpredictable
 
nature
 
of
 
modern
 
projects.
 
The
 
study
 
calls
 
for
 
further
 
research
 
into
 
the
 
interplay
 
between
 
project
 
complexity,
 
stakeholder
 
behavior,
 
and
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
cognitive
 
biases
 
on
 
decision-making.
