Summary :  
This
 
paper
 
examines
 
the
 
limitations
 
of
 
project
 
management
 
tools
 
and
 
software
 
in
 
addressing
 
critical
 
human
 
and
 
strategic
 
factors
 
that
 
influence
 
project
 
success.
 
While
 
modern
 
project
 
management
 
methodologies
 
emphasize
 
efficiency,
 
cost
 
reduction,
 
and
 
on-time
 
delivery,
 
many
 
projects
 
still
 
fail
 
due
 
to
 
neglected
 
factors
 
such
 
as
 
stakeholder
 
engagement,
 
leadership
 
oversight,
 
and
 
change
 
management.
 
The
 
study
 
identifies
 
ten
 
key
 
failure
 
points,
 
including
 
poor
 
customer
 
focus,
 
inadequate
 
risk
 
management,
 
lack
 
of
 
accountability,
 
and
 
insufficient
 
post-implementation
 
planning.
 
The  research  highlights  how  project  teams  often  prioritize  technical  execution  over  stakeholder  relationships,  leading  to  
misalignment
 
with
 
organizational
 
goals
 
and
 
reduced
 
project
 
adoption.
 
Findings
 
from
 
enterprise
 
system
 
deployment
 
projects
 
illustrate
 
how
 
overlooking
 
human
 
factors—such
 
as
 
role
 
clarity,
 
leadership
 
engagement,
 
and
 
change
 
readiness—results
 
in
 
delays,
 
resistance,
 
and
 
inefficiencies.
 
The
 
study
 
advocates
 
for
 
a
 
strategic
 
project
 
management
 
approach
 
that
 
integrates
 
leadership,
 
change
 
management,
 
and
 
stakeholder
 
alignment
 
into
 
project
 
planning
 
and
 
execution.
 
To  mitigate  these  issues,  the  paper  recommends  defining  clear  project  roles,  establishing  formal  feedback  mechanisms,  improving  
vendor
 
accountability,
 
and
 
implementing
 
structured
 
change
 
management
 
practices.
 
It
 
also
 
underscores
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
project
 
managers
 
to
 
develop
 
interpersonal
 
skills,
 
leadership
 
competencies,
 
and
 
a
 
customer-focused
 
mindset
 
to
 
enhance
 
project
 
outcomes.
 
The
 
authors
 
argue
 
that
 
sustainable
 
project
 
success
 
requires
 
a
 
shift
 
from
 
rigid
 
process
 
adherence
 
to
 
a
 
holistic,
 
quality-focused
 
approach
 
that
 
considers
 
both
 
technical
 
execution
 
and
 
human
 
dynamics.
