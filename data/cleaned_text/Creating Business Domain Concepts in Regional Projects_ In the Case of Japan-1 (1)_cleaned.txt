Authors :  M.  Tanifuji,  K.  Uenishi  
Summary :  
This
 
paper
 
explores
 
the
 
formation
 
of
 
business
 
domain
 
concepts
 
in
 
regional
 
projects,
 
focusing
 
on
 
industrial
 
clusters
 
and
 
green
 
energy
 
initiatives
 
in
 
Japan.
 
Using
 
the
 
Ishikari
 
region
 
of
 
Hokkaido
 
as
 
a
 
case
 
study,
 
the
 
research
 
examines
 
how
 
organizations
 
collaborate
 
across
 
industry,
 
academia,
 
and
 
government
 
to
 
establish
 
sustainable
 
regional
 
development
 
projects.
 
The
 
study
 
applies
 
the
 
concept
 
of
 
Ba
,
 
a
 
framework
 
in
 
knowledge
 
creation
 
management,
 
to
 
analyze
 
the
 
interactions
 
and
 
decision-making
 
processes
 
that
 
contribute
 
to
 
the
 
success
 
of
 
regional
 
projects.
 
The  study  highlights  the  role  of  Ba  in  fostering  cooperation  among  diverse  stakeholders,  enabling  knowledge  sharing,  and  
expanding
 
the
 
boundaries
 
of
 
collaboration.
 
A
 
key
 
case
 
examined
 
is
 
the
 
"Snow
 
and
 
Cool
 
Heat
 
Energy
 
Project,"
 
which
 
utilizes
 
natural
 
cold
 
air
 
for
 
industrial
 
and
 
commercial
 
applications.
 
The
 
research
 
details
 
how
 
companies,
 
local
 
governments,
 
and
 
universities
 
worked
 
together
 
to
 
transform
 
this
 
concept
 
into
 
a
 
viable
 
business
 
model,
 
supported
 
by
 
government
 
grants
 
and
 
technical
 
expertise.
 
The
 
involvement
 
of
 
third-sector
 
organizations
 
(joint
 
public-private
 
entities)
 
played
 
a
 
crucial
 
role
 
in
 
bridging
 
business
 
interests
 
with
 
regional
 
policy
 
objectives.
 
Findings  suggest  that  regional  entrepreneurship,  particularly  Kirznerian  and  Schumpeterian  entrepreneurial  approaches,  influences  
the
 
success
 
of
 
projects
 
by
 
shaping
 
their
 
direction
 
and
 
ensuring
 
long-term
 
viability.
 
The
 
study
 
concludes
 
that
 
expanding
 
the
 
Ba
 
framework
 
to
 
include
 
external
 
funding
 
sources,
 
flexible
 
membership,
 
and
 
inter-organizational
 
cooperation
 
can
 
enhance
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
regional
 
business
 
projects.
 
It
 
also
 
suggests
 
that
 
future
 
research
 
should
 
explore
 
the
 
theoretical
 
boundaries
 
of
 
Ba
 
in
 
organizational
 
studies
 
to
 
better
 
understand
 
its
 
role
 
in
 
regional
 
development.
